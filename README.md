CreateJS Playground
===================

This is a small playground to get my hands on EaselJS, TweenJS, and other libs from CreateJS.
I'll update it with my different tests in using those libs so that it can maybe serve as a tutorial for others.

Please not that most (or all) of these demos will use jQuery.

Available samples
=================

[TweenJS Sample #2](public/demos/tweenjs-sample2)
-------------------------------------------------
A "new" implementation of the second sample provided by CreateJS for the TweenJS library. This sample uses EaselJS and
TweenJS to draw concentric circles that can be moved smoothly on the screen by clicking somewhere... 

**Libs**

  * jQuery v1.8.1
  * EaselJS v0.5.0
  * TweenJS v0.3.0


[PreloadJS #1](public/demos/preloadjs-1)
----------------------------------------
This sample is an almost full image gallery script that uses PreloadJS to preload photos before displaying them.
All images are listed in a ***manifest.json*** file. This file is loaded first and parsed, then all photo thumbnails are
loaded as well as the full-size photos.

The script uses PreloadJS features to display progress information for full-size photos loading, by slowly fading in the
thumbnail images.  

**Libs**

  * jQuery v1.8.1
  * PreloadJS v0.2.0
