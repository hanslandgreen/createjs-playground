TweenJS Sample #2
=================

This is a “new” implementation of the sample #2 given by CreateJS with the TweenJS library.

The main difference resides in the creation of a ```Circles``` class that handles the initialization, drawing and 
tweening of the circles.

This sample demonstrates:

  * EaselJS basic usage (```Stage```, ```Ticker```)
  * Subclassing EaselJS ```Container``` class
  * Animating the DOM with the ```DOMElement``` class
  * Basic usage of TweenJS to smoothly move things around
